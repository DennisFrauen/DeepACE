#### Introduction
This repository contains the code to our paper [Estimating average causal effects from patient trajectories](https://github.com/DennisFrauen/DeepACE/blob/main/Doc/DeepACE_submission.pdf).

#### Requirements
The project is built with following libraries:
1. [Pytorch-Lightning] - deep learning models
2. [Optuna] - hyperparameter tuning

#### Datasets


#### Reproducing experiments on synthetic data

#### Reproducing experiments on semi-synthetic data

#### Reproducing experiments on real-word data

#### Reproducing hyperparameter tuning
